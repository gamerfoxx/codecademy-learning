Let’s review what you’ve learned so far! Find each of these points in app.js:

    On line 1, import React from 'react' creates a JavaScript object. This object contains properties that are needed to make React work, such as React.createElement() and React.Component.

    On line 2, import ReactDOM from 'react-dom' creates another JavaScript object. This object contains methods that help React interact with the DOM, such as ReactDOM.render().

    On line 4, by subclassing React.Component, you create a new component class. This is not a component! A component class is more like a factory that produces components. When you start making components, each one will come from a component class.

    Whenever you create a component class, you need to give that component class a name. That name should be written in UpperCamelCase. In this case, your chosen name is MyComponentClass.
