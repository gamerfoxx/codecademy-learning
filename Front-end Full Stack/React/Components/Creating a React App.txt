$ sudo npm install -g npm@latest

If you’ve previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, it is recommended that you uninstall the package first. In your terminal run these commands:

$ npm uninstall -g create-react-app
$ npx create-react-app myfirstreactapp

If you’ve never installed create-react-app before, you can simply run this command:

$ npx create-react-app myfirstreactapp

If you have Yarn installed, create-react-app will use it by default to create new projects. If you would prefer to use npm, you can append --use-npm to the creation command. It will look like this:

$ npx create-react-app myfirstreactapp --use-npm
